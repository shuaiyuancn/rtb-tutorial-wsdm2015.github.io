        <p>This website is for the WSDM 2015 Tutorial: Real-Time Bidding: A New Frontier of Computational Advertising Research.</p>

<p>The tutorial will be given by <a href="http://yuan-shuai.info">Dr. Shuai Yuan</a> and <a href="http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/blog/about">Dr. Jun Wang</a> in Feb 2015 during the <a href="http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2015">WSDM conference</a> in Shanghai, China.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tutorial-cikm-2013.computational-advertising.org">first version</a> of the tutorial was given in <a href="http://www.cikm2013.org">CIKM 2013</a> in San Francisco, USA. After the conference the latest slides will be shared here, too.</p>

<a id="brief-introduction" class="anchor" href="#brief-introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Brief introduction</h1>

<p>In display and mobile advertising, the most significant development in recent years is the Real-Time Bidding (RTB), which allows selling and buying in real-time one ad impression at a time. Since then, RTB has fundamentally changed the landscape of the digital marketing by scaling the buying process across a large number of available inventories.  The demand for automation, integration and optimisation in RTB brings new research opportunities in the IR/DM/ML fields. However, despite its rapid growth and huge potential, many aspects of RTB remain unknown to the research community for many reasons. In this tutorial, together with invited distinguished speakers from online advertising industry, we aim to bring the insightful knowledge from the real-world systems to bridge the gaps and provide an overview of the fundamental infrastructure, algorithms, and technical and research challenges of this new frontier of computational advertising. We will also introduce to researchers the datasets, tools, and platforms which are publicly available thus they can get hands-on quickly.</p>

<p>This tutorial aims to provide not only a comprehensive and systematic introduction to RTB and computational advertising in general, but also the emerging research challenges and research tools and datasets in order to facilitate the research. Compared to previous Computational Advertising tutorials in relevant top-tier conferences, this tutorial takes a fresh, neutral, and the latest look of the field and focuses on the fundamental changes brought by RTB. 
We expect the audience, after attending the tutorial, to understand the real-time online advertising mechanisms and the state of the art techniques, as well as to grasp the research challenges in this field. Our motivation is to help the audience acquire domain knowledge and obtain relevant datasets, and to promote research activities in RTB and computational advertising in general. </p>

<p><strong>Dr. Shuai Yuan</strong> recently received his Ph.D. from University College London. He has been working on mathematical models of online advertising with a number of companies such as AppNexus, Advance International Media, Bright, Dot.tk, and Miaozhen. He has the background of information retrieval, data mining, machine learning, and economic theories; his research interests on computational advertising have focused on supply side optimisation in RTB, bidding algorithms, and statistical arbitrage. Shuai Yuan has published several papers in top-tier venues including CIKM, SIGKDD, and ADKDD. Among them, he published the first empirical study on RTB auctions. He and his colleagues won the third season of iPinyou Global Bidding Algorithm Competition in 2013, and the Best Paper Award of ADKDD 2014. He also contributes to an open advertising dataset project.</p>
